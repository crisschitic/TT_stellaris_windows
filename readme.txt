git hub for windows
http://windows.github.com/

What it is all about?
Some of the guys may use windows in order to play with the stelaris board.
To make for the the life easyer I'll make a technology template, to explain
step by step what they should do to have all the thinks working.

As opperating system I used XP for testing porpose and if the scripts will work on XP
I'll do my next step for windows 7

In order to make a script I need to learn how to do it.
